# Push_Swap_Visualizer
This is a repository that i create to upload my own version of visualizer that runs with 42 project Push Swap. Push Swap is a first cercle project based on data and algorithms, it is written in C. The visualizer on the other hand is created to work with that project, but uses up knowledge from the last cercles of common core in 42. Written in C++. 

In the note.txt file is all the information about the inspiration of writting this code. And a list of processes executed in order for this to work. ^^

Here is a video on how it works on a first stage:
