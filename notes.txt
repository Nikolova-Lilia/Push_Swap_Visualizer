I had to evaliate someone on push swap two days ago and since it's been
over an year now, I decided i know now more than what i used to back then
when i was only staring my career and was doing push swap myself. So here 
is a simple(hopefully) version of visualizer for the push swap project 
created by using C++ knowleage.

But first things first. Push Swap is a project about sorting a stack
of numbers by using only one two stacks and while having a limits on
how the numbers can be moved from stack tostack. 
Also the idea is to move numbers with less moves possible.
So now that we have all this set on the table, lets talk about the 
visualizer.It must generate numbers as many as the user required to check
the push swap program. The numbers must be generated randomly, 
also important the user must be able to set frames on the numbers. 
Meaning, for example range of -100 up to 100. 

As mantioned already, I am going to use C++ to create it. 
And also I would be creating a Console-Based Visualizer(meaning Text-Based). 
Pluses on that choice are faster execution (C++ in particular), also it will
integrate well with the existing C program. 
Step one - creating a Randow Number Generator. -> RandNumbGen.cpp
1. User inputs how many numbers to generate
2. User specifies the range(min & max values)
3. Generate random numbers and display them

Once this is complete i am moving on to passing the values to my own
C program.
